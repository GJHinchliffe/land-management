### Wildflower Meadow & Pasture


### Nature Borders
In order to improve the variety of the ecosystem some consideration has been given to creating a 'nature border' around the field. The various ways such a border could be achieved are outlined below 
#### Fencing
The border will need to be physically separated from the rest of the field to ensure the prosperity of the plant speicies within. Without this it will be too easy for the animals or machinery to distupt the species.

The most effective way to achieve such a border in a short timescale is to fence off an area around the perimiter of the land in which the border will exist.

The current plot already has a perimiter fence, however a second fence will need to be erected to create the border. The length of this second fence needs to be determined, priced up, and funding secured.
#### Hedging
A hedge is one of the possible forms the border could take. This form has well understood benefits to the local ecosystem, to the extent that public funding is available to those wishing to plant one. More details about this funding model can be found below.
##### Funding
##### Sourcing Trees
###### Woodland Trust
#### Wooded Area
As an alternative to a hedge, the possibility of creating a thin strip of woodland is also being considered. This woodland would also lie in the strip of land created by the double fence.
##### Funding
**Whether or not funding is available for this proposal is currently unknown; this is something that needs to be researched.**

If it is not possible to find any information about this online, it appears that another local farm have adopted such an idea and as such they could be approached to see if there is indeed funding available.
##### Sourcing Trees
Such an area would, of course, also require trees. **It is, however, unknown whether the woodland trust would be able to provide trees for this purpose.** We have accress to a fairly large number of small saplings which could be used to fill a section of the perimiter, however there are not enough to fill the entire border. **As such, further research must be done on how to obtain trees for this purpose.**
