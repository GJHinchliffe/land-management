### Wildflower Meadow & Pasture
Creating a wildflower meadow and pasture would improve the quality of the land by multiple metrics. Firstly, it will help to improve the variety of flora and fauna species present, while also improving the quantity of food produced by the land. This is due to the current prevalance of common rush on the land, which is well-suited to the wet, acidic soil.

Further information on how the wildflower meadow and pasture should be managed can be found in [this](magnificnet-meadows--hay_meadow_and_pasture_management.pdf) document produced by [Magnificent Meadows](http://www.magnificentmeadows.org.uk/). However, before the land can be developed into a wildflower meadow and pasture, there are multiple issues which first need to be addressed:
+ Drainage
+ Common Rush
+ Poaching

Once these issues have been addressed to a sufficient level the wildflower meadow could be developed. This would then provide a food source which would be grazed and harvested to feed to animals during the winter months. For the meadow and pasture to fulfill this purpose, serious thought would have to be given to the grazing cycle, ensuring that the wildflower seeds have sufficient time to flower and produce seed before they are eaten or mown. Possible cycles are proposed in the [Magnificent Meadows document](magnificnet-meadows--hay_meadow_and_pasture_management.pdf), however they do not address the issue of animal storage and food supply during the growing periods. One possible way of managing this predicament is with mob grazing.

### Nature Borders
In order to improve the variety of the ecosystem some consideration has been given to creating a 'nature border' around the field. The various ways such a border could be achieved are outlined below 
#### Fencing
The border will need to be physically separated from the rest of the field to ensure the prosperity of the plant speicies within. Without this it will be too easy for the animals or machinery to distupt the species.

The most effective way to achieve such a border in a short timescale is to fence off an area around the perimiter of the land in which the border will exist.

The current plot already has a perimiter fence, however a second fence will need to be erected to create the border. The length of this second fence needs to be determined, priced up, and funding secured.
#### Hedging
A hedge is one of the possible forms the border could take. This form has well understood benefits to the local ecosystem, to the extent that public funding is available to those wishing to plant one. More details about this funding model can be found below.
##### Funding
##### Sourcing Trees
Tree whips can be purchased for approx. Â£0.50 each. -https://www.millfarmtrees.co.uk/hedging-plants-c1/hawthorn-p15
###### Woodland Trust
#### Wooded Area
As an alternative to a hedge, the possibility of creating a thin strip of woodland is also being considered. This woodland would also lie in the strip of land created by the double fence.
##### Funding
**Whether or not funding is available for this proposal is currently unknown; this is something that needs to be researched.**

If it is not possible to find any information about this online, it appears that another local farm have adopted such an idea and as such they could be approached to see if there is indeed funding available.
##### Sourcing Trees
Such an area would, of course, also require trees. **It is, however, unknown whether the woodland trust would be able to provide trees for this purpose.** We have accress to a fairly large number of small saplings which could be used to fill a section of the perimiter, however there are not enough to fill the entire border. **As such, further research must be done on how to obtain trees for this purpose.**
### Pedigree Dorset Sheep Breeding
The wildflower meadow and pasture could be the primary food source for the sheep, however, as mentioned [above](#Wildflower-Meadow--Pasture), some thought will have to be given to the rotation of the sheep to ensure that the wildflowers are given suffient time to flower and seed. **There are further question marks over how many sheep the land can home.** However, once this is determined, the current flock of 5 Dorset ewes can be used as breeding stock to grow the herd up to a sustainable level; whenceforth any additional flock members can be sold as either breeding stock or for meat. **Is it possible that this meat will have higher value due to the way in which it will have been raised? (i.e. through organic farming methods on a wildflower meadow/pasture)**
#### Other Sheep Products
##### Tups
Due to their pedigree it should be possible to sell the young tups at a higher price for breeding.
##### Wool
**Although this needs further research, I am led to believe that Dorset wool has a higher value than other sheep breeds. This is certainly worth looking into.**

### Market Garden
There are multiple large greenhouses and raised beds on site, which, although currently overrun, could be made productive again and facilitate the production of fruit and vegatables for a 'market garden'.
